## Setup
Install [Frugally-Deep](https://github.com/Dobiasd/frugally-deep) and point to it in the jucer exporters and project settings Header search paths.
On Windows we recommend using the [vcpkg utility](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) following [these steps](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#getting-started) and then in Juce headers pointing directly to vcpkg's **include** subdirectory that was created.
